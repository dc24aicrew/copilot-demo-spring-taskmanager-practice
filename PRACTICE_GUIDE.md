# üß™ Practice Guide for Copilot Demo

## üéØ Quick Start for Practice

### Step 1: Copy Full Project from Original
```bash
# You need to copy the complete project structure from the original repository
# This practice repo currently only has the README and issues

# 1. Clone original repository
git clone https://github.com/dc24aicrew/copilot-demo-spring-taskmanager.git original

# 2. Copy all content to this practice repo
cp -r original/* .
cp original/.gitignore .
cp -r original/.github .

# 3. Commit everything
git add .
git commit -m "Copy complete project for practice"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Practice Copilot Assignment
1. **Start with Issue #2** (Security - smaller scope, safer for first practice)
2. **Visit:** https://github.com/dc24aicrew/copilot-demo-spring-taskmanager-practice/issues/2
3. **Practice the Copilot assignment process**
4. **Rehearse your demo talking points**

### Step 3: Build Confidence
- Practice different demo flows (15min, 30min, 45min)
- Test your screen sharing setup
- Prepare backup materials
- Time your segments
